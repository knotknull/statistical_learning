Itâ€™s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.
-Yogi Berra

Statistical learning:
    - supervised:   building a statistical model for predicting / estimating an output
                    based on one or more inputs
    - unsupervised: inputs but no supervising output

notations:
 - n: represents the number of distinct data points 
 - p: number of variables that are available for use in predictions


Xij: represents the jth variable for the ith observation
    where i = 1, 2, .... n
    and   j = 1, 2, .... p

        i == index the samples / observations ( 1 to n)
        J == index the variables  ( 1 to p)
        X == n x p matrix whose (i,j)th element is Xij


             +- X11  X12  .... X1p  -+
             |  X21  X22  .... X2p   | 
        X =  |  .     .   .      .   | 
             |  .     .    .     .   |
             |  .     .      .   .   |
             +- Xn1            Xnp  -+

    "rows" of X are vectors of length p 
       containing p variable measurements 
    hence  Xi ==  vecotr of rows

             +- Xi1 -+
             |  Xi2  | 
        Xi=  |  .    | 
             |  .    |
             |  .    |
             +- Xip -+


or XJ == vector columns of 

             +- X1j -+
             |  X2j  | 
        Xj=  |  .    | 
             |  .    |
             |  .    |
             +- Xnj -+



XT == transpose matrix (flip on axis)


             +- X11  X21  .... Xn1  -+
             |  X12  X22  .... Xn2   | 
        XT = |  .     .   .      .   | 
             |  .     .    .     .   |
             |  .     .      .   .   |
             +- X1p   X2p      Xnp  -+


multiplying two matrices A and B.

    the (i, j) the element of AB is computed by 
    multiplying each for (-->) of A by the corresponding
    element of the jth column of B  |
                                    v
given 
        A = [1  2]        B = [5  6]
            [3  4]            [7  8]


Then 

AB =    [1  2]  *  [5  6]  == [1*5 + 2*7    1*6 + 2*8 ]  == [19  22]
        [3  4]     [7  8]     [3*5 + 4*7    3*6 + 4*8 ]     [43  50] 


NOTE: r x s matrix.  only possible of AB has number 
      of columns in A is the same as the number of rows of B
